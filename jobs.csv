============


DimRed is building a platform to automate the most challenging parts of scaling AI Agents and LLM\\-based systems. We believe the path forward for AI systems is grounded in reliability and interpretability. Our platform leverages first principles\\-based thinking and ML theory to automate the manual process of iterating on prompts, LLM evaluations, and agent experimentation.


Our mission is to enable anyone to easily automate knowledge work with LLMs through task demonstration.

**The Role**
============


We are looking for a **Founding Engineer, Backend** who will be critical to the design and development of highly scalable, data\\-intensive AI systems. You’ll partner closely with the CEO and research scientists to bridge the gap between research and production, and your work will directly shape the foundation of DimRed's platform.

**What You’ll Do**
==================

* **Design and implement core backend services** that power large\\-scale evaluations, agent workflows, and data pipelines.
* **Own orchestration for long\\-running workflows** (hours days) with durable execution, retries, and robust state management.
* **Build and productionize vector search infrastructure** (e.g., pgvector, Pinecone) to support retrieval\\-augmented generation and agent memory.
* **Establish secure multi\\-tenant foundations** (organizations, API keys, RBAC, audit logs) aligned with enterprise and SOC2 requirements.
* **Work directly with customers** to understand integration challenges and translate them into backend features and APIs.

**What We’re Looking For**
==========================

* **2–4 years** of experience as a software engineer building data\\-intensive backends (startup experience preferred).
* Strong skills in **Python (FastAPI, asyncio)**, with clean, maintainable coding practices.
* Familiarity with **Kubernetes, Docker, and AWS** services (EKS/ECS, RDS/Aurora, S3, IAM).
* Hands\\-on experience with **async and event\\-driven systems** (queues/streams like SQS, Kafka, or EventBridge).
* Knowledge of **vector databases** (pgvector, Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.).
* Strong understanding of **security best practices**, including RBAC, least\\-privilege IAM, and data encryption.
* Comfort with **observability** (metrics, tracing, logging) and debugging complex distributed systems.
* Ability to thrive in an **early\\-stage startup environment**: ambiguity, rapid iteration, and direct customer feedback loops.

**Benefits**
============

* Competitive salary and top\\-of\\-market equity compensation.
* Flexible PTO policy.
* Professional development budget.
* AI tooling budget.
* Opportunity to **shape the direction** of a fast\\-growing startup.

**Why Join DimRed?**
====================


As one of the first engineers, you’ll shape our architecture, culture, and engineering practices. You’ll work at the intersection of AI research and production systems—turning ideas into infrastructure that scales. If you want to help define how reliable and interpretable AI agents are built, we’d love to talk.

At AWS AI our vision is to make deep learning pervasive for everyday developers and to democratize access to cutting edge infrastructure. In order to deliver on that vision, we’ve created innovative software and hardware solutions that make it possible.  

  

AWS Neuron SDK is the complete software stack for the AWS Inferentia and Trainium machine learning accelerators designed by Annapurna Labs inside AWS. The Neuron SDK consists of a compiler, runtime, frameworks, and tooling customers need. It’s also preinstalled in AWS Deep Learning AMIs and Deep Learning Containers for customers to quickly get started with running high performance and cost\\-effective inference and training.  

  

This position is for a Software Engineer for the AWS Neuron SDK team with a deep background in Linux and device drivers. Deep knowledge and experience with hardware\\-based accelerator platforms (such as encryption, TCP offload, storage accelerators and router/switch platforms) and the necessary complexity for the software layers that interact and manage them. Experience implementing high performance software drivers, needed to ensure high throughput from software to hardware, is also a necessity. This engineer will work with the team to define the key interfaces and will develop the runtime stack and driver that manages the accelerator.  

  

This is a fast\\-paced, intellectually challenging position, where you’ll work with thought\\-leaders in multiple technology areas. You’ll have high standards for yourself and everyone you work with, and you’ll be constantly looking for ways to improve our products' performance, quality and cost.
